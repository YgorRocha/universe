# UNIVERSE

# Single Page Application 

## Description of the project.

This project is a simple example of a Single Page Application (SPA) developed using a routing architecture to manage the different pages of a website without the need to reload the entire page.

The main advantage of an SPA is the improved user experience, as content is updated more quickly and dynamically, without the need to reload the entire page.

The project uses ES modules to manage the code structure and dependencies between files. This allows for better code control and organization, as well as facilitating module reuse and maintenance.

In addition, the class structure was used to create the Router class, allowing for better code organization and readability. This structure also enables the creation of class instances with their own properties and methods, which is a good practice for larger projects, as it allows for better scalability and maintenance.

The project can be cloned and executed locally on any web server. To run, simply open the index.html file in a browser.
